    **Hi!**

    My name is Luigi and I am a second-year PhD student in the [SapienzaNLP Group](http://sapienzanlp.uniroma1.it/) led
    by [Prof. Roberto Navigli](http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/).

    I am currently working on Semantic Parsing and Word Sense Disambiguation, and I have a real passion for generative
    models (those seq2seq-s are amazing).

    I attained my bachelor's degree in *Computer Engineering* from [Università degli Studi Roma Tre](https://www.uniroma3.it/)
    and, a couple of years later, my master's degree in *Engineering in Computer Science* from
    [Sapienza Università di Roma](https://www.uniroma1.it/).

    The master's degree was quite the crossroad for me, finding both AI and Security very appealing. Eventually, I went
    for AI, but Security still had a significant impact: no matter where I go, within a couple of months, I always
    inevitably become the Linux/DevOps guy (thank you, past self).

    I am quite the binge-watcher, I have recently started playing padel quite a lot (even though skying still remains
    my favorite sport) and I enjoy playing videogames now and then.

    Anyway, if you wish to contact me, feel free to use any of the social channels on the left!
